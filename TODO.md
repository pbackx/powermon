1. Limit the graph to only show the last hour

# Doing

# Backlog

Bigger tasks that need to be split in smaller items:

1. ~~Calculate 15 minutes power usage~~, display it and expose as new sensor to HA
2. ~~Calculate peak power usage per month~~, display it and expose as new sensor to HA
3. Add logo and favicon
4. Package as a proper add-on
