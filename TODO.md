# TODO list

This is a list where I document simple tasks that are easy to pick up and get going:

1. Round numbers to at most 2 decimals and remove dot as thousands separator
2. When restarting HA, it looks like the add-on tries to connect to the websocket too early. Some retry mechanism needs to be added.
3. Reconnect to HA websocket when connection is lost

# Backlog

Bigger tasks that need to be split in smaller items:

1. Add logo and favicon
2. Add "dummy" section to README
2. Package as a proper add-on
3. Use the VREG simulator to give a better estimate of peak impact.
