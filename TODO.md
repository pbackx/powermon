# TODO list

This is a list where I document simple tasks that are easy to pick up and get going:

1. Limit the graph to only show the last hour (maybe make it configurable?)

# Doing

1. Use WebSocket API to capture and display current energy usage

# Backlog

Bigger tasks that need to be split in smaller items:

1. Add a way to add new nodes to the graph. This will require a new API endpoint and a new form in the UI.v
2. Calculate 15 minutes power usage and expose as new sensor
3. Calculate peak power usage per month and expose as new sensor
4. Ask fiverr to design a nice favicon/logo for the project
