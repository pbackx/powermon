# TODO list

This is a list where I document simple tasks that are easy to pick up and get going:

1. Fix peak display (it seems to be showing the same values as average) => DONE, but to be tested
2. Also send averages and peaks on websocket connect 

# Doing

1. ~~Calculate 15 minutes power usage~~, display it and expose as new sensor to HA
2. ~~Calculate peak power usage per month~~, display it and expose as new sensor to HA

# Backlog

Bigger tasks that need to be split in smaller items:

1. Show yearly average
2. Add logo and favicon
3. Package as a proper add-on
