# TODO list

This is a list where I document simple tasks that are easy to pick up and get going:

1. styling everything. Maybe try Foundation to test out alternatives to Bootstrap? https://get.foundation/sites/docs/installation.html https://github.com/digiaonline/react-foundation
2. Limit the graph to only show the last hour (maybe make it configurable?)
