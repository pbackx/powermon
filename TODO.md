# TODO list

This is a list where I document simple tasks that are easy to pick up and get going:

1. Correctly expose the data to HA
2. Improve legend on x-axis of graphs

# Doing

1. ~~Calculate 15 minutes power usage, display it~~ and expose as new sensor to HA
2. ~~Calculate peak power usage per month, display it~~ and expose as new sensor to HA

# Backlog

Bigger tasks that need to be split in smaller items:

1. Add logo and favicon
2. Package as a proper add-on
3. Find a way to access the database for development purposes (probably requires enabling dev SSH access)
