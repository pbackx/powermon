# TODO list

This is a list where I document simple tasks that are easy to pick up and get going:

1. styling everything. Maybe try Foundation to test out alternatives to Bootstrap? https://get.foundation/sites/docs/installation.html https://github.com/digiaonline/react-foundation
2. Limit the graph to only show the last hour (maybe make it configurable?)

# Doing

1. Use WebSocket API to capture and display current energy usage

# Backlog

Bigger tasks that need to be split in smaller items:

1. Add a way to add new nodes to the graph. This will require a new API endpoint and a new form in the UI.v
2. Calculate 15 minutes power usage and expose as new sensor
3. Calculate peak power usage per month and expose as new sensor
